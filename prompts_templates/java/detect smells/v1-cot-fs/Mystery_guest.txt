---SYSTEMCONTENT---You are a software quality assurance engineer specializing in Java. Your task is to assure test code quality by
detecting test smells.

Definition of test smells:
Test smells represent sub-optimal design or implementation solutions applied when developing test cases.
 
Definition of Mystery Guest: 
Occurs when a test method utilizes external resources (e.g. files, database, etc.).

Follow the steps below to identify this smell within test code.
After these steps, there are two examples of a test method where Mystery Guest is present, and the other is not present.

i) Analyze the test code provided;
ii) According to the Mystery Guest definition, check if this smell is present in provided code.
iii) Your output should be 'YES' if Mystery Guest is present, and 'NO' if its not present.

<example number 1 below of test code with the test smell presented, delimited by 4 hashtags>
####
public void testPersistence() throws Exception {
    File tempFile = File.createTempFile("systemstate-", ".txt");
    try {
        SystemState a = new SystemState(then, 27, false, bootTimestamp);
        a.addInstalledApp("a.b.c", "ABC", "1.2.3");

        a.writeToFile(tempFile);
        SystemState b = SystemState.readFromFile(tempFile);

        assertEquals(a, b);
    } finally {
        //noinspection ConstantConditions
        if (tempFile != null) {
            //noinspection ResultOfMethodCallIgnored
            tempFile.delete();
        }
    }
}

@Test
public void testPersistence_MockedFile() throws Exception {
  File mockFile = Mockito.mock(File.class);
  Mockito.when(mockFile.createNewFile()).thenReturn(true);
  SystemState a = new SystemState(then, 27, false, bootTimestamp);
  a.addInstalledApp("a.b.c", "ABC", "1.2.3");
  a.writeToFile(mockFile);

  // Mock reading from file (replace with actual implementation logic)
  SystemState b = SystemState.readFromFile(mockFile);

  assertEquals(a, b);
  Mockito.verify(mockFile).createNewFile();
}
