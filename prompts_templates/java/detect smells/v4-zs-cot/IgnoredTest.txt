Let's proceed step by step. First, you will be provided with test code delimited by triple backticks. Second, I want to check if the test smell known as "Ignored Test" is present in this test code. This test smell occurs when a test method or class will not be executed due to the @Ignore annotation in tag. Third, according to the definition of "Ignored Test" you should answer 'yes' if you identify this test smell in the test code, or you should answer 'no' if you don't find this test smell in the presented test code.

Now, analyze the test code below:
```{class_code}```
