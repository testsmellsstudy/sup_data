Let's proceed step by step. First, you will be provided with test code delimited by triple backticks. Second, I want to check if the test smell known as "Assertion Roulette" is present in this test code. This test smell occurs when a test method has multiple undocumented assertions. Third, according to the definition of "Assertion Roulette" you should answer 'yes' if you identify this test smell in the test code, or you should answer 'no' if you don't find this test smell in the presented test code.

Now, analyze the test code below:
```{class_code}```
