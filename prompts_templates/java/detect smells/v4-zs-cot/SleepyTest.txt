Let's proceed step by step. First, you will be provided with test code delimited by triple backticks. Second, I want to check if the test smell known as "Sleepy Test" is present in this test code. This test smell occurs when an artificial delay is introduced by the developer for a certain duration (i.e., simulate an external event) and then continue with the execution. Third, according to the definition of "Sleepy Test" you should answer 'yes' if you identify this test smell in the test code, or you should answer 'no' if you don't find this test smell in the presented test code.

Now, analyze the test code below:
```{class_code}```
