Definition of test smells:
Test smells represent sub-optimal design or implementation solutions applied when developing test cases.

Let's proceed step by step. First, you will be provided with test code delimited by triple backticks. Second, I want to check if the test smell known as "Sensitive Equality" is present in this test code. This test smell occurs when the toString method is used within a test method. Test methods verify objects by invoking the default toString() method of the object and comparing the output against an specific string. Third, according to the definition of "Sensitive Equality" you should answer 'yes' if you identify this test smell in the test code, or you should answer 'no' if you don't find this test smell in the presented test code.

Now, analyze the test code below:
```{class_code}```
