Definition of Magic Number Test: 
An assertion method that contains a numeric literal as an argument.

Follow the steps below to identify this smell within test code.
After these steps, there is an example of a test method where Magic Number is present.

i) Analyze the test code provided;
ii) According to the Magic Number definition, check if this smell is present in provided code.
iii) Your output should be 'YES' if Magic Number is present, and 'NO' if its not present.

<Check the example below>
####
@Test
public void testGetLocalTimeAsCalendar() {
    Calendar localTime = calc.getLocalTimeAsCalendar(BigDecimal.valueOf(15.5D), Calendar.getInstance());
    assertEquals(15, localTime.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY));
    assertEquals(30, localTime.get(Calendar.MINUTE));
}
