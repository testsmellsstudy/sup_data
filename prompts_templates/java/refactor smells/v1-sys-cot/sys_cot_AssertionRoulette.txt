Your task is to refactor the test code in order to eliminate test smell present in the code. 
The test smell present in the provided test code is: 
Assertion Roulette: Occurs when a test method has multiple non-documented assertions.
Follow the steps below to refactor the Assertion Roulette:

<Step 1> Analyze the test code provided delimited by 4 hashtags;
<Step 2> Understand what this test code is testing, and which test framework its been used;
<Step 3> Locate where the Assertion Roulette occurs;
<Step 4> Based on test framework used, refactor this part of the test code to eliminate Conditional Test logic Smell. You can modify the test method as you wish, but keep in mind that you should maintain the test's context.
<Step 5> Give me only the test code you refactored.
