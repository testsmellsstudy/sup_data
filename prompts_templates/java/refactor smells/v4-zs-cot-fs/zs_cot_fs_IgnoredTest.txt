Let's start step by step. First, this test code contains a test smell known as "Ignored Test", which occurs when a test method or class will not be executed due to the @Ignore annotation. Second, I need a version of this code that keeps the same test's intention but mitigates this smell. 
One approach involves transforming it into a comment or deleting the test method.

An one-shot example is provided to you to be used as a reference:

Example 1:
<Provided test code>
####
@Ignore("disabled for now as this test is too flaky")
public void peerPriority() throws Exception {
	final List addresses = Lists.newArrayList(
    	new InetSocketAddress("localhost", 2000),
        new InetSocketAddress("localhost", 2001),
        new InetSocketAddress("localhost", 2002)
	);
    peerGroup.addConnectedEventListener(connectedListener);
    .....
}
####
<Refactored test code>
####

####

Now provide the refactored test code for the code below, delimited by triple backticks.
Attention: Preserve all existing import statements in the Java code. You may introduce new packages as needed.
