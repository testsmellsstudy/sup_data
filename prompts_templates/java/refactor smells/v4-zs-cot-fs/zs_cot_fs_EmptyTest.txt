Let's start step by step. First, this test code contains a test smell known as "Empty Test", which occurs when a test case does not contain a single executable statement. Second, I need a version of this code that keeps the same test's intention but mitigates this smell. 
One approach involves deleting this test method or comment the test code, because this test method is useless.

An one-shot example is provided to you to be used as a reference:

Example 1:
<Provided test code>
```
@Test
public void testCredGetFullSampleV1() {
    Credentials credentials = innerCredTest(FULL_SAMPLE_v1);
    // assertEquals("p4ssw0rd", credentials.getPass());
    // assertEquals("user@example.com", credentials.getUser());
}
```
<Refactored test code>
```
// @Test
// public void testCredGetFullSampleV1() {
    Credentials credentials = innerCredTest(FULL_SAMPLE_v1);
    // assertEquals("p4ssw0rd", credentials.getPass());
    // assertEquals("user@example.com", credentials.getUser());
// }
```

Now provide the refactored test code for the code below, delimited by triple backticks.
Attention: Preserve all existing import statements in the Java code. You may introduce new packages as needed.
