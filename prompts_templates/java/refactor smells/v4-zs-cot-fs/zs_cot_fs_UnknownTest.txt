Let's start step by step. First, this test code contains a test smell known as "Unknown Test", which occurs when a test method that does not contain a single assertion statement and @Test(expected) annotation parameter.
Second, I need a version of this code that keeps the same test's intention but mitigates this smell. 
One approach involves creating an assertion for this test method, or deleting the test method.

An one-shot example is provided to you to be used as a reference:

Example 1:
<Provided test code>
####
@Test
public void hitGetPOICategoriesApi() throws Exception {
    POICategories poiCategories = apiClient.getPOICategories(16);
    for (POICategory category : poiCategories) {
      System.out.println(category.name() + ": " + category);
    }
}
####
<Refactored test code>
####

####

Now provide the refactored test code for the code below, delimited by triple backticks.
Attention: Preserve all existing import statements in the Java code. You may introduce new packages as needed.
