Let's start step by step. First, this test code contains a test smell known as "Redundant Print", which occurs when a test method contains a statement that prints anything to the console. Second, I need a version of this code that keeps the same test's intention but mitigates this smell. 
One approach involves deleting this line code where the test prints, or transforms this line code into a comment.

An one-shot example is provided to you to be used as a reference:

Example 1:
<Provided test code>
```
@Test
public void testTransform10mNEUAndBack() {
    Leg northEastAndUp10M = new Leg(10, 45, 45);
    Coord3D result = transformer.transform(Coord3D.ORIGIN, northEastAndUp10M);
    System.out.println("result = " + result);
    Leg reverse = new Leg(10, 225, -45);
    result = transformer.transform(result, reverse);
    assertEquals(Coord3D.ORIGIN, result);
}
```
<Refactored test code>
```
@Test
public void testTransform10mNEUAndBack() {
    Leg northEastAndUp10M = new Leg(10, 45, 45);
    Coord3D result = transformer.transform(Coord3D.ORIGIN, northEastAndUp10M);
    Leg reverse = new Leg(10, 225, -45);
    result = transformer.transform(result, reverse);
    assertEquals(Coord3D.ORIGIN, result);
}
```

Now provide the refactored test code for the code below, delimited by triple backticks.
Attention: Preserve all existing import statements in the Java code. You may introduce new packages as needed.
