Let's start step by step. First, this test code contains a test smell known as "Conditional Test Logic", which occurs when a test method contains one or more control statements (i.e., if, switch, conditional expression, foreach, and while statements). Second, I need a version of this code that keeps the same test's intention but mitigates this smell. 
One approach involves understanding the framework used in this test code in order to replace the snippet where "Conditional Test Logic" occurs and rewrite it in a way that reproduces the same test meaning, but not using any control statements mentioned earlier. 

An one-shot example is provided to you to be used as a reference:

Example 1:
<Provided test code>
```
public class ExampleTest {

    @Test
    public void testExample() {
        int value = 10;
        if (value > 5) {
            assertEquals(10, value);
        } else {
            assertEquals(5, value);
        }
    }
}
```
<Refactored test code>
```
import static org.junit.Assume.assumeTrue;
public class ExampleTest {

    @Test
    public void testExample() {
        int value = 10;
	condition = (value > 5);
        assumeTrue("Verifying if value is higher than 5", condition);
        assertEquals(5, value);
    }
}
```

Now provide the refactored test code for the code below, delimited by triple backticks.
Attention: Preserve all existing import statements in the Java code. You may introduce new packages as needed.
