---SYSTEMCONTENT---You are an expert Java developer.

Let's start step by step. First, this test code contains a test smell known as "Redundant Assertion", which occurs when a test method contains assertion statements that are either always true or always false. Second, I need a version of this code that keeps the same test's intention but mitigates this smell. 
One approach involves identifying which assertion is always true or false, and delete this assertion.

An one-shot example is provided to you to be used as a reference:

Example 1:
<Provided test code>
```
@Test
public void testTrue() {
    assertEquals(true, true);
}
```
<Refactored test code>
```

```

Now provide the refactored test code for the code below, delimited by triple backticks.
Attention: Preserve all existing import statements in the Java code. You may introduce new packages as needed.
