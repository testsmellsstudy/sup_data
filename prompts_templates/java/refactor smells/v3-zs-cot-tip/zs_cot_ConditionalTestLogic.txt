---SYSTEMCONTENT---You are an expert Java developer. 

---USERCONTENT---Your task is to refactor the Java test code provided within triple backticks.
```
{test_code_with_smell_here}
```

Let's start step by step. First, this test code contains a test smell known as "Conditional Test Logic", which occurs when a test method contains one or more control statements (i.e., if, switch, conditional expression, foreach, and while statements). Second, I need a version of this code that keeps the same test's intention but mitigates this smell. 
One approach involves understanding the framework used in this test code in order to replace the snippet where "Conditional Test Logic" occurs and rewrite it in a way that reproduces the same test meaning, but not using any control statements mentioned earlier. 

Now provide this refactored test code, delimited by four hashtags:
