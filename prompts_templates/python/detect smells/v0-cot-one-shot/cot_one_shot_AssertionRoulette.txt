detecting test smells.

Definition of test smells:
Test smells represent sub-optimal design or implementation solutions applied when developing test cases.

Definition of Assertion Roullete:
A test method contains more than one assertion statement and they're non-documented.

Follow the steps below to identify this smell within test code.
After these steps, there is an example of a test method where Assertion Roulette is present.

i) Analyze the test code provided;
ii) According to the Assertion Roulette definition, check if this smell is present in provided code.
iii) Your output should be 'YES' if Assertion Roulette is present, and 'NO' if its not present.

<Check the example below>

####
class CRCTestCase(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_all(self):
        self.assertEqual(crc(0, 0), 0)
        self.assertEqual(crc(85, 170), 43614)
