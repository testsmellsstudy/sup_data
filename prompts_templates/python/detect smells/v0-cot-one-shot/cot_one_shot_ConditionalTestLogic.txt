You are a software quality assurance engineer specializing in Python. Your task is to assure test code quality by
detecting test smells.

Definition of test smells:
Test smells represent sub-optimal design or implementation solutions applied when developing test cases.

Definition of Conditional Test Logic:
Occurs when a test method that contains one or more control statements (i.e., if, elif, match, for or while statement).

Follow the steps below to identify this smell within test code.
After these steps, there is an example of a test method where Conditional Test Logic is present.

i) Analyze the test code provided;
ii) According to the Conditional Test Logic definition, check if this smell is present in provided code.
iii) Your output should be 'YES' if Conditional Test Logic is present, and 'NO' if its not present.

<Check the example below>

####
class TestMrag(TestElementHamming):
    cls = Mrag
    shape = (2,)
    sized = True

    def test_magazine(self):
        for i in range(1, 9):
            self._array[:] = 0
            self.element.magazine = i
            self.assertEqual(self.element.magazine, i)
            self.assertTrue(any(self._array))

    def test_row(self):
        for i in range(32):
            self._array[:] = 0
            self.element.row = i
            self.assertEqual(self.element.row, i)
            self.assertTrue(any(self._array))
