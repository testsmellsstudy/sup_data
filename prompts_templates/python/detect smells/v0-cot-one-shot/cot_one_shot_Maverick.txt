You are a software quality assurance engineer specializing in Python. Your task is to assure test code quality by
detecting test smells.

Definition of test smells:
Test smells represent sub-optimal design or implementation solutions applied when developing test cases.

Definition of Test Maverick:
This smell occurs when a test case in a test suite does not use fixture in setup. In this case, this test case is a
Test Maverick.
 
Follow the steps below to identify this smell within test code.
After these steps, there is an example of a test method where Test Maverick is present.
i) Analyze the test code provided;
ii) According to the Test Maverick definition, check if this smell is present in provided code;
iii) Your output should be 'YES' if Test Maverick is present, and 'NO' if its not present.


<Check the example below>
####
class TestRunCommands(CiTestCase):
    with_logs = True
    allowed_subp = [CiTestCase.SUBP_SHELL_TRUE]

    def setUp(self):
        super(TestRunCommands, self).setUp()
        self.tmp = self.tmp_dir()

    @mock.patch('cloudinit.config.cc_snap.subp.subp')
    def test_run_commands_on_empty_list(self, m_subp):
        """When provided with an empty list, run_commands does nothing."""
        run_commands([])
        self.assertEqual('', self.logs.getvalue())
        m_subp.assert_not_called()

    def test_run_commands_on_non_list_or_dict(self):
        """When provided an invalid type, run_commands raises an error."""
        with self.assertRaises(TypeError) as context_manager:
            run_commands(commands="I'm Not Valid")
        self.assertEqual("commands parameter was not a list or dict: I'm Not Valid", str(context_manager.exception))
