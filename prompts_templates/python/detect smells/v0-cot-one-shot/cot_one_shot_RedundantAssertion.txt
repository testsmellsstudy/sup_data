You are a software quality assurance engineer specializing in Python. Your task is to assure test code quality by
detecting test smells.

Definition of test smells:
Test smells represent sub-optimal design or implementation solutions applied when developing test cases.

Definition of Redundant Assertion:
Occurs when a test case contains assertion statements that are either always true or always false, and are therefore
unnecessary.
 
Follow the steps below to identify this smell within test code.
After these steps, there is an example of a test method where Redundant Assertion is present.
i) Analyze the test code provided;
ii) According to the Redundant Assertion definition, check if this smell is present in provided code;
iii) Your output should be 'YES' if Redundant Assertion is present, and 'NO' if its not present.

<Check the example below>
####
class BasicPropertiesTests(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_equality(self):
        a = spec.BasicProperties(content_type='text/plain')
        self.assertEqual(a, a)
        self.assertNotEqual(a, None)

        b = spec.BasicProperties()
        self.assertNotEqual(a, b)
        b.content_type = 'text/plain'
        self.assertEqual(a, b)

        a.correlation_id = 'abc123'
        self.assertNotEqual(a, b)

        b.correlation_id = 'abc123'
        self.assertEqual(a, b)
