You are a software quality assurance engineer specializing in Python. Your task is to assure test code quality by
detecting test smells.

Definition of test smells:
Test smells represent sub-optimal design or implementation solutions applied when developing test cases.

Definition of Unknown Test:
A test method that does not contain a single assertion statement in any test method.

Follow the steps below to identify this smell within test code.
After these steps, there is an example of a test method where Unknown Test is present.
i) Analyze the test code provided;
ii) According to the Unknown Test definition, check if this smell is present in provided code;
iii) Your output should be 'YES' if Unknown Test is present, and 'NO' if its not present

<Check the example below>
####
class TestLinecard(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_lineCard(self):
        mod_class = Linecard
        CheckModule.check_module(self, mod_class, 'Lc', 'linecard')
        CheckModule.check_mod_parent(self, mod_class)
        CheckModule.check_mod_instance(self, mod_class)
        CheckModule.check_mod_get_url(self, mod_class)
        CheckModule.check_mod_get_json(self, mod_class)
