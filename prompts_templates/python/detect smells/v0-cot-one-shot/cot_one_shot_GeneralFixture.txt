You are a software quality assurance engineer specializing in Python.
Your task is to assure test code quality by detecting test smells.

Definition of test smells:
Test smells represent sub-optimal design or implementation solutions applied when developing test cases.

Definition of General Fixture:
Occurs when not all fields instantiated within the setUp method of a test class are utilized by all test methods
in the same test class.

Follow the steps below to identify this smell within test code.
After these steps, there is an example of a test method where General Fixture is present.
i) Analyze the test code provided;
ii) According to the General Fixture definition, check if this smell is present in provided code;
iii) Your output should be 'YES' if General Fixture is present, and 'NO' if its not present.

<Check the example below>
####
class TestHTTPParamFileDoesNotExist(BaseAWSCommandParamsTest):

    def setUp(self):
        super(TestHTTPParamFileDoesNotExist, self).setUp()
        self.stderr = six.StringIO()
        self.stderr_patch = mock.patch('sys.stderr', self.stderr)
        self.stderr_patch.start()

    def tearDown(self):
        super(TestHTTPParamFileDoesNotExist, self).tearDown()
        self.stderr_patch.stop()

    def test_http_file_param_does_not_exist(self):
        error_msg = "Error parsing parameter '--filters': Unable to retrieve http://does/not/exist.json: received non 200 status code of 404"
        with mock.patch('awscli.paramfile.URLLib3Session.send') as get:
            get.return_value.status_code = 404
            self.assert_params_for_cmd('ec2 describe-instances --filters http://does/not/exist.json', expected_rc=255, stderr_contains=error_msg)
