You are a software quality assurance engineer specializing in Python. Your task is to assure test code quality by
detecting test smells.

Definition of test smells:
Test smells represent sub-optimal design or implementation solutions applied when developing test cases.

Definition of Duplicate Assert:
A test method that contains more than one assertion statement with the same parameters.

Follow the steps below to identify this smell within test code.
After these steps, there are two examples: one where Duplicate Assert is present, and the other is not present.

i) Analyze the test code provided;
ii) According to the Duplicate Assert definition, check if this smell is present in provided code.
iii) Your output should be 'YES' if Duplicate Assert is present, and 'NO' if its not present.

<example number 1 below of test code with the test smell presented, delimited by 4 hashtags> 
####
class SubpageTestCase(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_checksum(self):
        p = Subpage()
        self.assertEqual(57917, p.checksum)
        p = Subpage(prefill=True)
        self.assertEqual(57917, p.checksum)
####

<example number 2 of test code below with not the test smell, delimited by 4 hashtags>
####
class SubpageTestCase(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_checksum(self):
        p1 = Subpage()
        p2 = Subpage(prefill=True)
        self.assertEqual(57917, p1.checksum)
        self.assertEqual(57917, p2.checksum)
