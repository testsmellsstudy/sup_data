You are a software quality assurance engineer specializing in Python. Your task is to assure test code quality by
detecting test smells.

Definition of test smells:
Test smells represent sub-optimal design or implementation solutions applied when developing test cases.

Definition of Unknown Test:
A test method that does not contain a single assertion statement in any test method.

Follow the steps below to identify this smell within test code.
After these steps, there are two examples: one where Unknown Test is present, and the other is not present.

i) Analyze the test code provided;
ii) According to the Unknown Test definition, check if this smell is present in provided code;
iii) Your output should be 'YES' if Unknown Test is present, and 'NO' if its not present

<example number 1 below of test code with the test smell presented, delimited by 4 hashtags>

class TestLiveAppProfile(TestLiveAPIC):

  def test_invalid_app(self):
      session = self.login_to_apic()
      self.assertRaises(TypeError, AppProfile.get, session, None)

  def test_valid_preexisting_app(self):
      session = self.login_to_apic()

<example number 2 of test code below with not the test smell, delimited by 4 hashtags>
####
class TestLiveAppProfile(TestLiveAPIC):

  def test_invalid_app(self):
    session = self.login_to_apic()
    self.assertRaises(TypeError, AppProfile.get, session, None)

  def test_valid_preexisting_app(self):
    session = self.login_to_apic()
    # Add assertion to verify AppProfile.get works as expected
    # Here's an example assuming 'app_id' is retrieved elsewhere:
    app_id = "valid_app_id"  # Replace with how you get the ID
    app_profile = AppProfile.get(session, app_id)
    self.assertIsNotNone(app_profile)  # Assert retrieved profile is not None
