You are a software quality assurance engineer specializing in Python. Your task is to assure test code quality by
detecting test smells.

Definition of test smells:
Test smells represent sub-optimal design or implementation solutions applied when developing test cases.

Definition of Exception Handling:
A test method that contains try-except block.

Follow the steps below to identify this smell within test code.
After these steps, there are two examples: one where Exception Handling is present, and the other is not present.

i) Analyze the test code provided;
ii) According to the Exception Handling definition, check if this smell is present in provided code.
iii) Your output should be 'YES' if Exception Handling is present, and 'NO' if its not present.

def test_exception_handling(mocker):
  mock_variable = mocker.Mock()
  mocker.patch('my_module.some_variable', mock_variable)

  try:
    my_module.my_function()
    # If this line executes, the test fails because the exception wasn't raised
    assert mock_variable.method_called.call_count == 1
  except ValueError as e:
    # The expected exception was raised, continue testing
    assert str(e) == "Something went wrong!"
####

<example number 2 of test code below with not the test smell, delimited by 4 hashtags>

def test_successful_execution(mocker):
  """Tests my_module.my_function for successful execution."""

  mock_variable = mocker.Mock()
  mocker.patch('my_module.some_variable', mock_variable)

  # Call the function
  my_module.my_function()

  # Assert the expected behavior (e.g., variable modification)
  assert mock_variable.method_called.call_count == 1


def test_exception_raised(mocker):
  """Tests my_module.my_function for expected exception."""

  # Mock the function to raise a ValueError
  mocker.patch('my_module.some_variable', side_effect=ValueError("Something went wrong!"))

  # Call the function and expect the exception with pytest.raises
  with pytest.raises(ValueError) as e:
    my_module.my_function()

  # Assert the specific error message
  assert str(e.value) == "Something went wrong!"
