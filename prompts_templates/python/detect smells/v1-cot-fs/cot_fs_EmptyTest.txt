You are a software quality assurance engineer specializing in Python. Your task is to assure test code quality by
detecting test smells.

Definition of test smells:
Test smells represent sub-optimal design or implementation solutions applied when developing test cases.

Definition of Empty Test:
A test case does not contain a single executable statement.

Follow the steps below to identify this smell within test code.
After these steps, there are two examples: one where Empty Test is present, and the other is not present.

i) Analyze the test code provided;
ii) According to the Empty Test definition, check if this smell is present in provided code.
iii) Your output should be 'YES' if Empty Test is present, and 'NO' if its not present.

<example number 1 below of test code with the test smell presented, delimited by 4 hashtags> 
####
def test_cred_get_full_sample_v1:
    pass
####

<example number 2 of test code below with not the test smell, delimited by 4 hashtags>
####
def test_cred_get_full_sample_v1:
     credentials =  innerCredTest(FULL_SAMPLE_v1);
     assert "p4ssw0rd" == credentials.pass
     assert "user@example.com" == credentials.user
