You are a software quality assurance engineer specializing in Python. Your task is to assure test code quality by
detecting test smells.

Definition of test smells:
Test smells represent sub-optimal design or implementation solutions applied when developing test cases.

Definition of Assertion Roullete:
A test method contains more than one assertion statement and they're non-documented.

Follow the steps below to identify this smell within test code.
After these steps, there are two examples: one where Assertion Roulette is present, and the other is not present.

i) Analyze the test code provided;
ii) According to the Assertion Roulette definition, check if this smell is present in provided code.
iii) Your output should be 'YES' if Assertion Roulette is present, and 'NO' if its not present.

<example number 1 below of test code with the test smell presented, delimited by 4 hashtags> 
####
class CRCTestCase(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_all(self):
        self.assertEqual(crc(0, 0), 0)
        self.assertEqual(crc(85, 170), 43614)
####

<example number 2 of test code below with not the test smell, delimited by 4 hashtags>
####
class CRCTestCase(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_all(self):
        self.assertEqual(crc(0, 0), 0, "Check that crc function returns 0 when both inputs are 0.")
        self.assertEqual(crc(85, 170), 43614, "Check that crc function returns the correct result for non-zero inputs.")
