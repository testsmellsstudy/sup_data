You are a software quality assurance engineer specializing in Python. Your task is to assure test code quality by
detecting test smells.

Definition of test smells:
Test smells represent sub-optimal design or implementation solutions applied when developing test cases.

Definition of Sleepy Test:
Occurs when an artificial delay is introduced by the developer for a certain duration (i.e., simulate an external event)
and then continue with the execution.

Follow the steps below to identify this smell within test code.
After these steps, there are two examples: one where Sleepy Test is present, and the other is not present.

i) Analyze the test code provided;
ii) According to the Sleepy Test definition, check if this smell is present in provided code;
iii) Your output should be 'YES' if Sleepy Test is present, and 'NO' if its not present.

<example number 1 below of test code with the test smell presented, delimited by 4 hashtags> 
####
def test_login_callback(self):
    tracker = FunctionCallTracker()
    self.assertFalse(tracker.has_been_called())
    session = Session('http://badapic', LOGIN, PASSWORD)
    session.register_login_callback(tracker.call)
    resp = session.login()
    self.assertFalse(session.logged_in())
    session.api = URL
    time.sleep(4)
    self.assertTrue(session.logged_in())
    self.assertTrue(tracker.has_been_called())
    session.deregister_login_callback(tracker.call))
####

<example number 2 of test code below with not the test smell, delimited by 4 hashtags>
####
import asyncio

async def test_login_callback(self):
  tracker = FunctionCallTracker()
  self.assertFalse(tracker.has_been_called())
  session = Session('http://badapic', LOGIN, PASSWORD)
  session.register_login_callback(tracker.call)

  # Initiate the login process asynchronously
  await session.login()

  # No delay needed, await handles asynchronous operations
  self.assertTrue(session.logged_in())
  self.assertTrue(tracker.has_been_called())

  session.deregister_login_callback(tracker.call)
