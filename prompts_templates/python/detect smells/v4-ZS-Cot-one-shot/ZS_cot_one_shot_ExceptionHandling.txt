You are a software quality assurance engineer specializing in Python. Your task is to assure test code quality by
detecting test smells.

Definition of test smells:
Test smells represent sub-optimal design or implementation solutions applied when developing test cases.

You are going to proceed step by step. First, you will be provided with test code delimited by triple backticks. Second, you should check the presence of a test smell known as "Exception Handling". This test smell occurs when passing or failing of a test case is dependent on the production method explicitly throwing an exception, using try-except block. Third, according to the definition of "Exception Handling" you should answer 'yes' if you identify this test smell in the test code, or you should answer 'no' if you don't find this test smell in the presented test code.


<The code below is an example Exception Handling is present>
####
class LineTestCase(unittest.TestCase):

    def noisegen(self, max_loc, max_scale):
        for n in range(10):
            for loc in range(0, max_loc + 1, max(1, max_loc // 8)):
                for scale in range(0, max_scale + 1, max(1, max_scale // 8)):
                    yield (np.clip(np.random.normal(loc, scale, size=(2048,)), 0, 255).astype(np.uint8).tobytes(), {'loc': loc, 'scale': scale})

    def setUp(self):
        Line.configure(Config(), force_cpu=True)

    def test_empty_rejection(self):
        lines = ((Line(data), params) for (data, params) in self.noisegen(256, 8))
        lines = ((line, params) for (line, params) in lines if line.is_teletext)
        for (line, params) in lines:
            self.assertFalse(line.is_teletext, f'Noise interpreted as teletext: {params}')

    @unittest.expectedFailure
    def test_known_teletext(self):
        try:
            with open(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'data', 'teletext.vbi'), 'rb') as f:
                lines = (Line(data, number) for (number, data) in FileChunker(f, 2048))
                for line in lines:
                    self.assertTrue(line.is_teletext, f'Line {line._number} false negative.')
        except FileNotFoundError:
            self.skipTest('Known teletext data not available.')
