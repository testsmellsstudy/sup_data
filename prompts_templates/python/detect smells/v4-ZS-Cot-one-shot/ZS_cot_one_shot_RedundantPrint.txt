You are a software quality assurance engineer specializing in Python. Your task is to assure test code quality by
detecting test smells.

Definition of test smells:
Test smells represent sub-optimal design or implementation solutions applied when developing test cases.

You are going to proceed step by step. First, you will be provided with test code delimited by triple backticks. Second, you should check the presence of a test smell known as "Redundant Print". This test smell occurs when a test method contains a statement that prints the value of a variable to the console. Third, according to the definition of "Redundant Print" you should answer 'yes' if you identify this test smell in the test code, or you should answer 'no' if you don't find this test smell in the presented test code.

<The code below is an example where Redundant Print is present>
####
class FilterSpecTests(unittest.TestCase):

    def filter_classes(self):
        for attr in dir(filters):
            if attr.endswith('Filter'):
                yield getattr(filters, attr)

    def test_boolean_filter_specs(self):
        for fcls in self.filter_classes():
            print(fcls)
            for fspec in fcls.BOOLEAN_FILTERS.values():
                self.assertTrue(callable(fspec.filter_function) or fspec.filter_function is None)
                self.assertTrue(isinstance(fspec.needed_keys, tuple))
                self.assertTrue(all((isinstance(key, str) for key in fspec.needed_keys)))
                self.assertTrue(isinstance(fspec.aliases, tuple))
                self.assertTrue(all((isinstance(key, str) for key in fspec.aliases)))
                self.assertTrue(isinstance(fspec.description, str))
