You are a software quality assurance engineer specializing in Python. Your task is to assure test code quality by
detecting test smells.

Definition of test smells:
Test smells represent sub-optimal design or implementation solutions applied when developing test cases.

You are going to proceed step by step. First, you will be provided with test code delimited by triple backticks. Second, you should check the presence of a test smell known as "Sleepy Test". This test smell occurs when an artificial delay is introduced by the developer for a certain duration (i.e., simulate an external event) and then continue with the execution. Third, according to the definition of "Sleepy Test" you should answer 'yes' if you identify this test smell in the test code, or you should answer 'no' if you don't find this test smell in the presented test code.

<The code below is an example where Sleepy Test is present>
####
class TestLiveSession(unittest.TestCase):
    """
    Tests for the Session class
    """

    def test_bad_password(self):
        session = Session(URL, LOGIN, 'badpassword')
        resp = session.login()
        self.assertFalse(resp.ok)

    def test_refresh_login(self):
        session = Session(URL, LOGIN, PASSWORD)
        resp = session.login()
        self.assertTrue(resp.ok)
        resp = session.refresh_login()
        self.assertTrue(resp.ok)

    def test_login_callback(self):
        tracker = FunctionCallTracker()
        self.assertFalse(tracker.has_been_called())
        session = Session('http://badapic', LOGIN, PASSWORD)
        session.register_login_callback(tracker.call)
        resp = session.login()
        self.assertFalse(session.logged_in())
        session.api = URL
        time.sleep(4)
        self.assertTrue(session.logged_in())
        self.assertTrue(tracker.has_been_called())
        session.deregister_login_callback(tracker.call)
####

Now, analyze the test code below:
