You are a software quality assurance engineer specializing in Python. Your task is to assure test code quality by
detecting test smells.

Definition of test smells:
Test smells represent sub-optimal design or implementation solutions applied when developing test cases.

You are going to proceed step by step. First, you will be provided with test code delimited by triple backticks. Second, you should check the presence of a test smell known as "Duplicate Assert". This test smell occurs when a test method that contains more than one assertion statement with the same parameters. Third, according to the definition of "Duplicate Assert" you should answer 'yes' if you identify this test smell in the test code, or you should answer 'no' if you don't find this test smell in the presented test code.


<The code below is an example where Duplicate Assert is present>
####
class TestTaboo(unittest.TestCase):
    """
    Test Taboo class
    """

    def test_create(self):
        """
        Test basic Taboo class creation
        """
        taboo = Taboo('taboo')
        self.assertTrue(isinstance(taboo, Taboo))

    def test_internal_get_contract_code(self):
        """
        Test _get_contract_code method
        """
        self.assertEqual(Taboo._get_contract_code(), 'vzTaboo')

    def test_internal_get_subject_code(self):
        """
        Test _get_subject_code method
        """
        self.assertEqual(Taboo._get_subject_code(), 'vzTSubj')

    def test_internal_get_subject_relation_code(self):
        """
        Test _get_subject_relation_code method
        """
        self.assertEqual(Taboo._get_subject_relation_code(), 'vzRsDenyRule')

    def test_get_parent_class(self):
        """
        Test _get_parent_class method
        """
        self.assertEqual(Taboo._get_parent_class(), Tenant)
####

Now, analyze the test code below:
```{class_code}```
