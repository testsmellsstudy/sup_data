You are a software quality assurance engineer specializing in Python. Your task is to assure test code quality by
detecting test smells.

Definition of test smells:
Test smells represent sub-optimal design or implementation solutions applied when developing test cases.

You are going to proceed step by step. First, you will be provided with test code delimited by triple backticks. Second, you should check the presence of a test smell known as "Unknown Test". This test smell occurs when a test method does not contain a single assertion. Third, according to the definition of "Unknown Test" you should answer 'yes' if you identify this test smell in the test code, or you should answer 'no' if you don't find this test smell in the presented test code.


<The code below is an example where Unknown Test is present>
####
class TestLinecard(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_lineCard(self):
        mod_class = Linecard
        CheckModule.check_module(self, mod_class, 'Lc', 'linecard')
        CheckModule.check_mod_parent(self, mod_class)
        CheckModule.check_mod_instance(self, mod_class)
        CheckModule.check_mod_get_url(self, mod_class)
        CheckModule.check_mod_get_json(self, mod_class)
