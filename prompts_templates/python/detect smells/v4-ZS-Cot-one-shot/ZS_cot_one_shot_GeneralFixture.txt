You are a software quality assurance engineer specializing in Python.
Your task is to assure test code quality by detecting test smells.

Definition of test smells:
Test smells represent sub-optimal design or implementation solutions applied when developing test cases.

You are going to proceed step by step. First, you will be provided with test code delimited by triple backticks. Second, you should check the presence of a test smell known as "General Fixture". This test smell occurs when not all fields instantiated within the setup method of a test class are utilized by all test methods in the same test class. Third, according to the definition of "General Fixture" you should answer 'yes' if you identify this test smell in the test code, or you should answer 'no' if you don't find this test smell in the presented test code.


<The code below is an example where General Fixture is present>
####
class TestHTTPParamFileDoesNotExist(BaseAWSCommandParamsTest):

    def setUp(self):
        super(TestHTTPParamFileDoesNotExist, self).setUp()
        self.stderr = six.StringIO()
        self.stderr_patch = mock.patch('sys.stderr', self.stderr)
        self.stderr_patch.start()

    def tearDown(self):
        super(TestHTTPParamFileDoesNotExist, self).tearDown()
        self.stderr_patch.stop()

    def test_http_file_param_does_not_exist(self):
        error_msg = "Error parsing parameter '--filters': Unable to retrieve http://does/not/exist.json: received non 200 status code of 404"
        with mock.patch('awscli.paramfile.URLLib3Session.send') as get:
            get.return_value.status_code = 404
            self.assert_params_for_cmd('ec2 describe-instances --filters http://does/not/exist.json', expected_rc=255, stderr_contains=error_msg)
####

Now, analyze the test code below:
```{class_code}```
