You are a software quality assurance engineer specializing in Python. Your task is to assure test code quality by
detecting test smells.

Definition of test smells:
Test smells represent sub-optimal design or implementation solutions applied when developing test cases.

You are going to proceed step by step. First, you will be provided with test code delimited by triple backticks. Second, you should check the presence of a test smell known as "Redundant Assertion". This test smell occurs when a test method contains too many setup steps. Third, according to the definition of "Redundant Assertion" you should answer 'yes' if you identify this test smell in the test code, or you should answer 'no' if you don't find this test smell in the presented test code.


<The code below is an example where Redundant Assertion is present>
####
class BasicPropertiesTests(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_equality(self):
        a = spec.BasicProperties(content_type='text/plain')
        self.assertEqual(a, a)
        self.assertNotEqual(a, None)

        b = spec.BasicProperties()
        self.assertNotEqual(a, b)
        b.content_type = 'text/plain'
        self.assertEqual(a, b)

        a.correlation_id = 'abc123'
        self.assertNotEqual(a, b)

        b.correlation_id = 'abc123'
        self.assertEqual(a, b)
####

Now, analyze the test code below:
```{class_code}```
