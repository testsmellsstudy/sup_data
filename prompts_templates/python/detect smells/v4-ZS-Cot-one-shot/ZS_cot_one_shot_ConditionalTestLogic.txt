You are a software quality assurance engineer specializing in Python. Your task is to assure test code quality by
detecting test smells.

Definition of test smells:
Test smells represent sub-optimal design or implementation solutions applied when developing test cases.

You are going to proceed step by step. First, you will be provided with test code delimited by triple backticks. Second, you should check the presence of a test smell known as "Conditional Test Logic". This test smell occurs when a test method contains one or more control statements (i.e., if, elif, match, for or while statement). Third, according to the definition of "Conditional Test Logic" you should answer 'yes' if you identify this test smell in the test code provided, or you should answer 'no' if you don't find this test smell in the provided test code.

<The code below is an example where Conditional Test Logic is present>

####
class TestMrag(TestElementHamming):
    cls = Mrag
    shape = (2,)
    sized = True

    def test_magazine(self):
        for i in range(1, 9):
            self._array[:] = 0
            self.element.magazine = i
            self.assertEqual(self.element.magazine, i)
            self.assertTrue(any(self._array))

    def test_row(self):
        for i in range(32):
            self._array[:] = 0
            self.element.row = i
            self.assertEqual(self.element.row, i)
            self.assertTrue(any(self._array))
