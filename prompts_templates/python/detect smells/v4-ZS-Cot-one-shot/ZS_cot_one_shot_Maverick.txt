You are a software quality assurance engineer specializing in Python. Your task is to assure test code quality by
detecting test smells.

Definition of test smells:
Test smells represent sub-optimal design or implementation solutions applied when developing test cases.

You are going to proceed step by step. First, you will be provided with test code delimited by triple backticks. Second, you should check the presence of a test smell known as "Test Maverick". This test smell occurs when a test method in a test suite does not use fixture in setup. In this case, this test case is a Test Maverick. Third, according to the definition of "Test Maverick" you should answer 'yes' if you identify this test smell in the test code, or you should answer 'no' if you don't find this test smell in the presented test code.


<The code below is an example where Test Maverick is present>
####
class TestRunCommands(CiTestCase):
    with_logs = True
    allowed_subp = [CiTestCase.SUBP_SHELL_TRUE]

    def setUp(self):
        super(TestRunCommands, self).setUp()
        self.tmp = self.tmp_dir()

    @mock.patch('cloudinit.config.cc_snap.subp.subp')
    def test_run_commands_on_empty_list(self, m_subp):
        """When provided with an empty list, run_commands does nothing."""
        run_commands([])
        self.assertEqual('', self.logs.getvalue())
        m_subp.assert_not_called()

    def test_run_commands_on_non_list_or_dict(self):
        """When provided an invalid type, run_commands raises an error."""
        with self.assertRaises(TypeError) as context_manager:
            run_commands(commands="I'm Not Valid")
        self.assertEqual("commands parameter was not a list or dict: I'm Not Valid", str(context_manager.exception))

Now, analyze the test code below:
