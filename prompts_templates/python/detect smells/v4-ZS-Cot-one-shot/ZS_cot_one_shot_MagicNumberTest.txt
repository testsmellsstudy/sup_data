You are a software quality assurance engineer specializing in Python. Your task is to assure test code quality by
detecting test smells.

Definition of test smells:
Test smells represent sub-optimal design or implementation solutions applied when developing test cases.

You are going to proceed step by step. First, you will be provided with test code delimited by triple backticks. Second, you should check the presence of a test smell known as "Magic Number Test". This test smell occurs when an assertion method contains a numeric literal as an argument. Third, according to the definition of "Magic Number Test" you should answer 'yes' if you identify this test smell in the test code, or you should answer 'no' if you don't find this test smell in the presented test code.

<The code below is an example where Magic Number Test is present>
####
class TestLiveSession(unittest.TestCase):
    """
    Tests for the Session class
    """

    def test_bad_password(self):
        session = Session(URL, LOGIN, 'badpassword')
        resp = session.login()
        self.assertFalse(resp.ok)

    def test_refresh_login(self):
        session = Session(URL, LOGIN, PASSWORD)
        resp = session.login()
        self.assertTrue(resp.ok)
        resp = session.refresh_login()
        self.assertTrue(resp.ok)

    def test_relogin_forever(self):
        session = Session(URL, LOGIN, 'badpassword', relogin_forever=True)
        resp = session.login()
        self.assertFalse(resp.ok)

    def test_bad_url(self):
        session = Session('http://badapic', LOGIN, PASSWORD)
        resp = session.login()
        self.assertFalse(resp.ok)
        self.assertEqual(resp.status_code, 404)
####

Now, analyze the test code below:
