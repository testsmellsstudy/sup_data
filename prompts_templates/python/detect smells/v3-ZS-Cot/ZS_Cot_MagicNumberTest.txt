Let's proceed step by step. First, you will be provided with test code delimited by triple backticks. Second, I want to check if the test smell known as "Magic Number Test" is present in this test code. This test smell occurs when an assertion method contains a numeric literal as an argument. Third, according to the definition of "Magic Number Test" you should answer 'yes' if you identify this test smell in the test code, or you should answer 'no' if you don't find this test smell in the presented test code.

Now, analyze the test code below:
```{class_code}```
